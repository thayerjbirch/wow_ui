Shift right click on headers within Buff Tracker and Debuff Tracker bar groups will remove all headers for units with same name as the selected unit (this is intended to help warlocks that have Absolute Corruption talent deal with bars that don't go away automatically).
Suppress invalid spell warning for obsolete spell id 202270.
Add coordinates display in the alignment grid overlay.

Add new option for single pixel icon border (only available with Pixel Perfect enabled and custom border, Masque, and Tukui/ElvUI skinning disabled).
Adjust icon trim from 6% to 7% in order to remove border art more completely.

Ensure bar backdrop frame's size and position are set prior to calling SetBackdrop to assign a border texture. This is a test build since it is not clear whether this change do anything but it also should do no harm.

Added "In Pet Battle" to bar group Show When options on General tab, allowing Raven to be used to track pet battle-related buffs and debuffs.
Fixed issue with "Zoom Icons" option for rectangular icons with Masque enabled (this combination was greyed out in r380).
Added option in custom bar groups to desaturate icon for ready bars, supporting a somewhat different look for cooldowns in icon configurations.

Fix Masque which was broken with the addition of zoomed option for rectangular icons.
Adjust frame levels for bar configurations slightly to allow icons to sit on top of bars without the bar border showing through the icon.
Update version number for 7.1 in .toc files.

Added special case to debuff tracker for Agony so that both time and count can be refreshed correctly in a macro that changes target.
Fixed issue with spell color sometimes not being correct for bars in debuff tracker created with an AOE spell or a macro that changes target.
Remove Corruption when not in combat if warlock has talent Absolute Corruption.
Remove trackers for first Soul Effigy when spell is recast and replacement Soul Effigy is summoned.

Fix issue with notification bars not appearing.
Changes to custom sort order fixed now to update in profile.

Change default for Hide Blizzard Runes to false. This may affect people using Raven's runes and they will need to manually enable this option if they still want Raven to hide Blizzard's default runes. Unfortunately, there have been enough changes to  Blizzard's code (and to other rune-related addons) that Raven could trigger Lua errors when used with addons that hide and show runes differently. Changes in this version also prevent Raven from referencing Blizzard runes when not on a deathknight and from repeatedly trying to show runes when other addons are trying to hide them.
