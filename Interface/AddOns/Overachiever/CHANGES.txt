v0.99.1
- "Adventurer of Azsuna", "Adventurer of Val'sharah": Added "need to kill" reminders for the criteria that needed manual entry of mob IDs.
- "Adventurer of Highmountain": Fixed incorrect "Recently spotted objective" text.
- Suggestions Tab: Fix inconsistency with the filter where a complete achievement is considered incomplete if it was suggested because of a criteria (the criteria being specific to your location while the achievement's other criteria are for elsewhere) and that criteria is incomplete for the current character.
